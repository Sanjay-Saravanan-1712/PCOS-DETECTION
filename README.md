# PCOS Detection and Stabilization Project

This project is focused on developing a comprehensive machine learning (ML) model that detects PCOS using 18 key parameters commonly found in medical and hormonal reports, such as FSH, LH, AMH, beta-HCG levels, follicle counts, and more. Unlike basic diagnostic apps that only consider simple data like cycle length, our model incorporates a broader range of factors for accurate and holistic PCOS detection.

Core Features:

Advanced Diagnosis: The model uses 18 parameters for detection, which are more reliable than traditional methods that rely on just a few indicators. These include medical data (FSH, LH, AMH, beta-HCG levels) and physical indicators (waist-to-hip ratio, hair growth, skin darkening, follicle numbers).

Severity Assessment: The app will also assess the seriousness of PCOS/PCOD and classify the user’s condition based on their data.

Personalized Recommendations:

Cycle Tracking: Like traditional apps, we provide accurate cycle length tracking.
Diet and Exercise Plans: Personalized diet plans, yoga routines, and exercise recommendations are provided to help stabilize PCOS/PCOD.
Yoga and Exercise Alerts: Personalized plans for yoga and physical exercises, with reminders through the wearable band.
Calorie Monitoring and Heart Rate Tracking: Real-time heart rate and calorie burn tracking through a custom-designed wearable device (planned to be built using the ESP32 microcontroller).
Wearable Device Integration: A wearable band will track real-time data like heart rate, calorie burn, and stress levels (via GSR sensor). The data will sync with the app via Bluetooth to help users better manage their condition.

Comprehensive Reports: Users can download detailed health reports, combining medical data and real-time tracking for better monitoring of their condition.

Stabilization Management: Designed for both PCOS and PCOD management, the stabilization part of the project includes personalized lifestyle adjustments to improve the user’s condition.
